### Using the “cars” dataset in R, build a linear model for stopping distance as a function of speed and replicate the analysis of your textbook chapter 3 (visualization, quality evaluation of the model, and residual analysis.)

```{r}
head(cars)
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```


```{r}
clm = lm(cars$dist~cars$speed, data=cars)
clm
```


```{r}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, xlab='Speed (mph)', ylab='Stopping Distance (ft)', main='Stopping Distance vs. Speed')
abline(clm,col=c("red"))
```


```{r}
summary(clm)
```

### Looks like the distribution is normal. 

```{r}
plot(clm$fitted.values, clm$residuals, xlab='Fitted Values', ylab='Residuals')
abline(0,0,col=c("red"))
```


```{r}
qqnorm(clm$residuals)
qqline(clm$residuals)
```
