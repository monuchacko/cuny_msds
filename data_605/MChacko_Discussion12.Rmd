### Using R, build a  regression model for data that interests you. Conduct residual analysis.  Was the linear model appropriate? Why or why not?

```{r}
processors <- read.csv("full_data.csv")
head(processors)

plot(processors$new_cases, processors$new_deaths)
```


```{r}
lm1=lm(processors$new_deaths~processors$new_cases)

plot(processors$new_cases, processors$new_deaths)
abline(lm1)

summary(lm1)
```


```{r}
plot(fitted(lm1),resid(lm1))

qqnorm(resid(lm1))
qqline(resid(lm1))

```
