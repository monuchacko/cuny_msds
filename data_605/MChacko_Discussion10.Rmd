### In American casinos, the roulette wheels have the integers between 1 and 36, together with 0 and 00. Half of the non-zero numbers are red, the other half are black, and 0 and 00 are green. A common bet in this game is to bet a dollar on red. If a red number comes up, the bettor gets her dollar back, and also gets another dollar. If a black or green number comes up, she loses her dollar. 

### (a) Suppose that someone starts with 40 dollars, and continues to bet on red until either her fortune reaches 50 or 0. Find the probability that her fortune reaches 50 dollars.

```{r}
p <- 18/38
p

q <- 20/38
q

v <- q/p
v

(v^40-1)/(v^50-1)
```
