### Using R, build a multiple regression model for data that interests you.  Include in this model at least one quadratic term, one dichotomous term, and one dichotomous vs. quantitative interaction term.  Interpret all coefficients. Conduct residual analysis.  Was the linear model appropriate? Why or why not?


```{r}
# Read data
covid_ds <- read.csv(file = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monuchacko/cuny_msds/master/data_605/full_data.csv')

#is.na(covid_ds)
covid_ds <- na.omit(covid_ds) 

knitr::kable(head(covid_ds))
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
glimpse(covid_ds)
```



```{r}
# Quadratic variable
case_qv <- covid_ds$new_cases^2

# Dichotomous vs. quantative interaction
case_di_qi <- covid_ds$new_cases * covid_ds$new_deaths

covid_model <- lm(new_cases ~ total_cases + case_qv + case_di_qi, data=covid_ds)
summary(covid_model)
```


```{r}
plot(covid_model$fitted.values, covid_model$residuals, xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals", main="Residuals vs. Fitted")
abline(h=0)
```


```{r}
qqnorm(covid_model$residuals)
qqline(covid_model$residuals)
```
