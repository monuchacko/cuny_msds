## ASSIGNMENT 4   

### 1.Problem set 1

In this problem, we’ll verify using R that SVD and Eigenvalues are related as workedout in the weekly module. Given a 3×2 matrix A

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\-1&0&4\end{bmatrix} \\
$$

(1) write code in R to compute $X = AA^T$ and $Y = AT^A$. Then, compute the eigen values and eigen vectors of X and Y using the built-in commans in R. Then, compute the left-singular, singular values, and right-singular vectors of A using the svd command.  Examine the two sets of singular vectors and show that they are indeed eigen vectors  of X and Y. In  addition,  the  two  non-zero  eigenvalues  (the  3rd  value  will be very close to zero, if not zero) of both X and Y are the same and are squares of the non-zero singular values of A.Your  code  should  compute  all  these  vectors  and  scalars  and  store  them  in  variables. Please add enough comments in your code to show me how to interpret your steps.

```{r}
# Setup the 3x2 matrix A
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,-1,0,4), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
A
```

```{r}
# Compute X
X <- t(A)%*%A
X
```

```{r}
# Compute Y
Y <- A%*%t(A)
Y
```

```{r}
# eigen vectors of X
eX <- eigen(X)
eX
```

```{r}
#eigen vectors of Y
eY <- eigen(Y)
eY
```


### Calculate Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigen decomposition of a square normal matrix to any $m\times n$ matrix.

![SVD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monuchacko/cuny_msds/master/data_605/assets/picsvd.png)

```{r}
# A is the matrix where single value decomposition is to be computed
svdA <- svd(A)
```

```{r}
# d is the vector containing the singular values of A
svdA$d

# u is a matrix whose columns contain the left singular vectors of A
svdA$u

# v is a matrix whose columns contain the right singular vectors of A
svdA$v
```

```{r}
# Compare u and eY
svdA$u == eY$vectors
```

```{r}
UL <- svdA$u
UL[,1] = -UL[,1]
round(UL,digits=5) == round(eY$vectors,digits=5)
```

```{r}
# compare v with the eigen value of X (2 bottom columns)
svdA$v == eX$vectors[3:2]
```


```{r}
# Compare v
VL <- svdA$v
VL[,1] = -VL[,1]
round(VL,digits=3) == round(eX$vectors[1:3,1:2],digits=3)
```

```{r}
# Compare the d values
v1=svdA$d^2
v1
```

```{r}
round(v1,digits=5) == round(eX$values[1:2],digit=5)
```


   
### 2.Problem Set 2

Using  the  procedure  outlined  in  section  1  of  the  weekly  handout,  write  a  function  to compute the inverse of a well-conditioned full-rank square matrix using co-factors.  In order to compute the co-factors, you may use built-in commands to compute the determinant. Your function should have the following signature:

B = myinverse(A) where A is a matrix and B is its inverse and A×B=I. The off-diagonal elements of I should be close to zero, if not zero.  Likewise, the diagonal elements should be close to 1, if not 1.  Small numerical precision errors are acceptable but the function myinverse should be correct and must use co-factors and determinant of A to compute the inverse. 


```{r}
myinverse = function(A){
  
  if(dim(A)[1] != dim(A)[2]) { 
    # Check if square
    return('ERROR : Matrix is not square') 
  }
  else if(det(A) == 0) {
    # Check if determinant is 0
    return('ERROR : Matrix is singular')
  }
  
  # Create co-factor matrix
  coMatrix = A * 0
  
  # Cofactoring
  for (i in 1:ncol(A)) {
    for (j in 1:nrow(A)) {
      coMatrix[i,j] = det(A[-i,-j]) * (-1)^(i+j) 
    }}

  inversed = t((coMatrix)/det(A))

  return(inversed)
}
```



```{r}
# Non square matrix should give error
nonsquaretest = matrix(c(1,5,4,3,7,3,2,1,4,2,1,4),nrow=3)
nonsquaretest
myinverse(nonsquaretest)
```

```{r}
# Singular matrix should give error
singulartest = matrix(c(0,0,0,0),nrow=2)
singulartest
myinverse(singulartest)
```

```{r}
# Create a 4x4 matrix
A = matrix(c(1,6,7,3,9,3,1,5,1,3,1,9,2,3,1,2),nrow=4)
A
```

```{r}
# Inverse the matrix
B = myinverse(A)
B
```

```{r}
I = round(A %*% B)
I
```


```{r}
# Check values
C = solve(A)
round(B,4)==round(C,4)
```
